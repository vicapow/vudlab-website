        <div class="col-lg-5">
          <p>Sometimes statistics lie, but more often humans mishear them. Like with Simpson's Paradox, which Wikipedia defines as</p>
          <blockquote><p>a paradox in which a trend that appears in different groups of data disappears when these groups are combined, and the reverse trend appears for the aggregate data.</p></blockquote>
          <p>Simpson's paradox is especially pernicious when we talk about causality. To the right, x appears to have a negative effect on y, but actually the opposite is true when you account for  color. </p>

      <h3>Berkeley Sex Discrimination Suit</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-5 ">
          <p>In 1973, University of California-Berkeley (where Lewis and Victor live) was sued for sex discrimination. Berkeley had just accepted 44% of male applicants but only 35% of female applicants.</p>
          <p>When a statistician, an anthropologist and a staff data processor looked at the evidence, they found the opposite:</p>
          <blockquote><p>If the data are properly pooled...there is a small but statistically significant bias in favor of women.</p><small>(p. 403)</small></blockquote>
          <p>"Properly pooled" means "broken down by department." Men more often applied to science and engineering departments, which require special technical skills but accept a large percentage of qualified applicants of both sexes. Women more often applied to humanities departments, which have fewer spaces but require, as a minimum to apply, only a standard undergradaute cirriculum.</p>
          <p>The authors concluded that any sexism occurred before Berkeley ever saw the applications:</p>
          <blockquote><p>Women are shunted by their socialization and education toward fields of graduate study that are generally more crowded, less productive of completed degrees, and less well funded, and that frequently offer poorer professional employment prospects</p></blockquote>

          <h4>What Simpson's Paradox is <em>not</em></h4>
          <p><strong>Simpson's:</strong>It was <a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2331677?uid=2&uid=4&sid=21102567680247">first mentioned</a> by British statistician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udny_Yule">Udny Yule</a> in 1903.</p>
          <p><strong>A paradox:</strong>Simpson's Paradox is just a special case ommitting variable bias.</p>
          <p><strong>Every ommitted variable problem:</strong> Women earn only 77 percent of what men do, but according to Cornell economists <a href="http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1248&context=ilrreview">Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn</a>, accounting for work experience, education, industry, and unionization shrinks the gap to 91% (p. 52). So, discrimination matters less than the `77 percent` stat would lead you to believe. But is this Simpson's paradox? No, because the correction isn't large enough for the effect of gender to vanish or change sign.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-5">
          <h4>Why it matters</h4>
          <p>Simpson's Paradox usually fools us where performance and demographics mingle. For example, <a href="http://iowahawk.typepad.com/iowahawk/2011/03/longhorns-17-badgers-1.html">on elementary school tests</a>, minority students in Texas outperform their peers in Wisconsin, but Texas has so many minority students that Wisconsin dominates it in state rankings. Ignoring demographics might lead Texas schools to waste money copying Wisconsin.</p>
